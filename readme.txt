The data is about Asteroids - NeoWs. 
NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.

Features responsible for claiming an asteroid to be hazardous



The dataset consists of 4687 data instances(rows) and 40 features(columns). Also, there are no null values in the dataset.

Some of the features’ description is given below;
‘Neo Reference ID’: This feature denotes the reference ID assigned to an asteroid.
‘Name’: This feature denotes the name given to an asteroid.
‘Absolute Magnitude’: This feature denotes the absolute magnitude of an asteroid. An asteroid’s absolute magnitude is the visual magnitude an observer would record if the asteroid were placed 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) away, and 1 AU from the Sun and at a zero phase angle.
‘Est Dia in KM(min)’: This feature denotes the estimated diameter of the asteroid in kilometres (KM).
‘Est Dia in M(min)’: This feature denotes the estimated diameter of the asteroid in meters(M).
‘Relative Velocity km per sec’: This feature denotes the relative velocity of the asteroid in kilometre per second.
‘Relative Velocity km per hr’: This feature denotes the relative velocity of the asteroid in kilometre per hour.
‘Orbiting Body’: This feature denotes the planet around which the asteroid is revolving.
‘Jupiter Tisserand Invariant’: This feature denotes the Tisserand’s parameter for the asteroid. Tisserand’s parameter (or Tisserand’s invariant) is a value calculated from several orbital elements(semi-major axis, orbital eccentricity, and inclination) of a relatively small object and a more substantial‘ perturbing body’. It is used to distinguish different kinds of orbits.
‘Eccentricity’: This feature denotes the value of eccentricity of the asteroid’s orbit. Just like many other bodies in the solar system, the realms made by asteroids are not perfect circles, but ellipses. The axis marked eccentricity is a measure of how far from circular each orbit is: the smaller the eccentricity number, the more circular the realm.
‘Semi Major Axis’: This feature denotes the value of the Semi Major Axis of the asteroid’s orbit. As discussed above, the realm of an asteroid is elliptical rather than circular. Hence, the Semi Major Axis exists.
‘Orbital Period’: This feature denotes the value of the orbital period of the asteroid. Orbital period refers to the time taken by the asteroid to make one full revolution around its orbiting body.
‘Perihelion Distance’: This feature denotes the value of the Perihelion distance of the asteroid. For a body orbiting the Sun, the point of least distance is the perihelion.
‘Aphelion Dist’: This feature denotes the value of Aphelion distance of the asteroid. For a body orbiting the Sun, the point of greatest distance is the aphelion.
‘Hazardous’: This feature denotes whether the asteroid is hazardous or not.
